# Drift — A Meditative Camera Experience

## Description
**Drift** is a reflective camera experience inspired by the quiet, contemplative moments in *Super Mario 64* — those times when you stop playing and simply exist in the space. The camera gently auto-scrolls through a twilight landscape larger than the screen, featuring parallax mountain layers, swaying trees, floating firefly-like particles, and a shimmering water surface.

The pacing is deliberately slow. The camera breathes — its speed subtly rises and falls — and the player can nudge it with arrow keys or by hovering near the screen edges. The world invites observation rather than action.

**Bonus feature (hidden symbols):** Nine symbolic glyphs (moons, stars, spirals, eyes, diamonds, hearts) are scattered throughout the world. They only become visible as soft glowing shapes when the camera drifts near them. Clicking a glowing symbol "discovers" it, and a counter tracks your progress. Finding all nine triggers a final message.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in Google Chrome (or run via GitHub Pages).
2. The camera auto-scrolls on its own — just watch and absorb.
3. Use **arrow keys** or **A/D** to gently nudge the camera speed.
4. Move your **mouse** near the left/right screen edges to nudge the camera.
5. When you see a **glowing symbol**, **click** on it to discover it.
6. Try to find all 9 hidden symbols.

## Iteration Notes

### Post-Playtest
1. Adjusted auto-scroll speed and breathing rhythm for a more meditative pace.
2. Tuned parallax layer speeds so depth feels natural and not jarring.
3. Made hidden symbols require proximity to appear, rewarding patient observation.

### Post-Showcase
1. Could add ambient sound (wind, chimes) for a multi-sensory experience.
2. Could implement a slow day/night color cycle for longer viewing sessions.
